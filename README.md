# Legendary Pokémon Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project explores the classification and prediction of Legendary Pokémon using various machine learning models. The primary objective is to employ different algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness in accurately classifying Pokémon into Legendary and Non-Legendary categories.

## Files
Classification_of_Legendary_Pokemon.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Created using Colaboratory.

Project Report - Legendary Pokémon Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning.pdf: Detailed project report outlining the methodologies, results, and conclusions.

pokemon.csv: Dataset file containing information about Pokémon, including features used for classification.

## Usage
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (Classification_of_Legendary_Pokemon.ipynb) to view the code, data analysis, and model training details.

Refer to the project report (Project Report - Legendary Pokémon Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning.pdf) for a comprehensive overview of the project, including insights, results, and comparisons.

## Dataset
The dataset (pokemon.csv) includes information such as Pokémon name, Pokédex number, types, height, weight, and various other attributes used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
